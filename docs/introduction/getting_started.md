## Why Pipeleek? {#why}

Scanning for credentials in CI/CD pipelines is interesting because secrets often end up in pipeline logs or build artifacts that traditional Git scanners won’t check.
This means you can catch leaked secrets that are injected or generated at runtime, not just those committed to Git.

Once secrets are discovered, further exploitation often requires additional tooling. Pipeleek provides several helper commands to assist with this process.

## Installation

### Quick Install (Linux/macOS)

Install the latest version with a single command:

```bash
curl -sL https://compasssecurity.github.io/pipeleek/install.sh | sh
```

> **⚠️ Security Warning:** Piping scripts directly to `sh` can be dangerous. Always review the script contents first at [https://compasssecurity.github.io/pipeleek/install.sh](https://compasssecurity.github.io/pipeleek/install.sh) before executing.

### Install with Go

Alternatively, install using Go:

```bash
go install github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleek/cmd/pipeleek@latest
```

### Linux

1. Visit the [Pipeleek GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleek/releases) page.

2. Download the binary for your architecture:

   - For Linux amd64: `pipeleek_<version>_linux_amd64`
   - For Linux arm64: `pipeleek_<version>_linux_arm64`

3. Make it executable and run it:

   ```bash
   chmod +x pipeleek_<version>_linux_amd64
   ./pipeleek_<version>_linux_amd64 --version
   ```

   You can rename and move it to a directory in your PATH:

   ```bash
   sudo mv pipeleek_<version>_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/pipeleek
   pipeleek --version
   ```

### macOS

1. Visit the [Pipeleek GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleek/releases) page.

2. Download the binary for your Mac architecture:

   - For Intel Macs (amd64): `pipeleek_<version>_darwin_amd64`
   - For Apple Silicon Macs (arm64): `pipeleek_<version>_darwin_arm64`

3. Make it executable and run it:

   ```bash
   chmod +x pipeleek_<version>_darwin_arm64
   ./pipeleek_<version>_darwin_arm64 --version
   ```

   You can move and rename it to a directory in your PATH:

   ```bash
   sudo mv pipeleek_<version>_darwin_arm64 /usr/local/bin/pipeleek
   pipeleek --version
   ```

   **Note:** On first run, macOS may block the binary. You can allow it in System Settings → Privacy & Security, or run:

   ```bash
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine pipeleek
   ```

### Windows

1. Visit the [Pipeleek GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleek/releases) page.

2. Download the Windows binary for your architecture:

   - For Windows amd64: `pipeleek_<version>_windows_amd64.exe`
   - For Windows arm64: `pipeleek_<version>_windows_arm64.exe`

3. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and verify installation:

   ```powershell
   .\pipeleek_<version>_windows_amd64.exe --version
   ```

   You can rename it for convenience:

   ```powershell
   Rename-Item pipeleek_<version>_windows_amd64.exe pipeleek.exe
   .\pipeleek.exe --version
   ```

### Platform-Specific Binaries

Pipeleek also provides platform-specific binaries that include only the commands for a specific platform. These are smaller and can be downloaded manually at [Pipeleek GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CompassSecurity/pipeleek/releases):

- `pipeleek-gitlab_<version>_<os>_<arch>` - GitLab commands only
- `pipeleek-github_<version>_<os>_<arch>` - GitHub commands only
- `pipeleek-bitbucket_<version>_<os>_<arch>` - BitBucket commands only
- `pipeleek-devops_<version>_<os>_<arch>` - Azure DevOps commands only
- `pipeleek-gitea_<version>_<os>_<arch>` - Gitea commands only

## Usage Examples

### Basic Scanning

The most basic example to scan e.g. GitLab pipeline logs for secrets.

```bash
pipeleek gl scan --token glpat-[redacted] --gitlab https://gitlab.example.com
```

### Scanning Artifacts

In addition to logs, Pipeleek can also scan artifacts generated by pipelines.

> **💡Tip:** All `scan` commands must be configured to scan artifacts. This feature is disabled by default.

```bash
pipeleek gl scan --token glpat-[redacted] --gitlab https://gitlab.example.com --artifacts
```
